Personal portfolio website built using React.js <!--, migrated from Create React App (CRA) to Vite for improved performance -->, originally based on the project by [Soumyajit4419](https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio).

<!-- Vite offers **faster build times, instant hot module replacement**, and a modern development experience compared to the decades-old CRA, ensuring a smoother and more efficient workflow for todayâ€™s web applications -->
